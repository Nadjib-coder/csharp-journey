# 🧭 CSharp Journey

Welcome to my **C# and ASP.NET learning journey**!
This repository tracks my progress as I learn **C#**, **.NET**, and **ASP.NET Core** — building small projects, practicing backend logic, and preparing for full-stack development.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Master **C# fundamentals** and **object-oriented programming**
- Learn to build **web applications with ASP.NET Core MVC**
- Explore **Entity Framework**, **LINQ**, and **API development**
- Integrate **front-end and back-end** skills for full-stack projects
- Prepare for **real-world production work** using C# and .NET

---

## 📘 Learning Resources

I’m currently studying from:

- [Official C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [ASP.NET Core Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
- [Microsoft Learn: C# and .NET Tracks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/dotnet/)
- YouTube tutorials and practical mini-projects
